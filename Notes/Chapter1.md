# Chapter 1 - Introduction Notes

The initial React release was 2013 by Facebook. React is not an SPA framework but a view library. It is the V in the MVC30 (model view controller). It only enables you to render components as viewable elements in a browser. Yet the whole ecosystem around React makes it possible to build single page applications.


While the first generation of frameworks tried to solve a lot of things at once, React only helps you to build your view layer. It’s a library and not a framework. The idea behind it: Your view is a hierarchy of composable components.

In React you can keep the focus on your view layer before you introduce more aspects to your application. Every other aspect is another building block for your SPA. These building blocks are essential to build a mature application. They come with two advantages.

First, you can learn the building blocks step by step. You don’t have to worry about understanding them altogether. It is different from a framework that gives you every building block from the start. This book focuses on React as the first building block. More building blocks follow eventually.

Second, all building blocks are interchangeable. It makes the ecosystem around React such an innovative place. Multiple solutions are competing with each other. You can pick the most appealing solution for you and your use case.
